There are many articles presented in the literature on teaching e-Learning courses. However, teaching a course in computer science and engineering where it involves hardware is a bit innovative. This work presents a complete Distance Learning (DL) course to teach Internet of Things (IoT). We propose a course that can fit both undergraduates and graduates. The course is divided into modules which could be taught separately and jointly. We will propose a methodology for assessment to achieve the set-forth outcomes.
