    "Ultrasonic Sensor:\n",
    "HC-SR04 is a commonly used module for non-contact distance measurement for distances from 2cm to 400cm. This sensor uses ultrasonic sound to measure distance just like bats and dolphins do. Ultrasonic sound has such a high pitch that humans cannot hear it. This particular sensor sends out an ultrasonic sound that has a frequency of about 40 kHz. The sensor has two main parts: a transducer that creates an ultrasonic sound and another that listens for its echo. The time difference between transmission and reception of ultrasonic signals is calculated. Using the speed of sound and ‘Speed = Distance/Time' equation, the distance between the source and target can be easily calculated.\n"
