We will learn to use it as a development board. It is impossible to cover everything that the Raspberry Pi is capable of, because the boundaries of the RPi is defined by your imagination. Hence, this manual serves as a guide to get you familiar with the RPi’s functionality by executing several labs that will give you the skills you need to develop your own projects."

A majority of the pins are directly connected to the SoC; so while connecting circuits or components, one should be careful to avoid wrong wiring and short circuits.
